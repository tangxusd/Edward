# Security Policy

## Supported versions

FableCut is distributed from the `main` branch. Security fixes are applied to the
latest release only.

| Version | Supported |

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/ronak-create/FableCut/security/advisories/new)
(Security → Advisories → *Report a vulnerability*). If that form is ever
unavailable, open a public issue that says only "security report — need a
private contact" (no details) and the maintainer will provide a channel.

Please include:

- A description of the issue and its impact
- Steps to reproduce (a minimal `project.json` or request is ideal)
- The affected file/endpoint and your environment (OS, Node version)

You can expect an initial acknowledgement within a few days. Once a fix is
released, we're happy to credit you unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope & threat model

FableCut is designed to run **locally** — `node server.js` binds an unauthenticated
HTTP server intended for a single trusted user on their own machine. Since
**v1.3.1** the server defends that boundary by default:

- It binds **127.0.0.1 only**. Exposing it on a LAN is an explicit opt-in
  (`HOST=0.0.0.0`, with allowed clients listed in `FABLECUT_ALLOWED_HOSTS`).
- Requests are validated against a **Host-header allowlist** (anti
  DNS-rebinding) and an **Origin allowlist** (anti cross-origin writes from
  malicious web pages).
- The static server refuses dot-files/dot-directories (`.git/` etc.).
- `POST /api/import-url` (and `fablecut_import_media` with an `https://` path)
  fetches a remote file into `./media/`. The fetch is **HTTPS-only** and
  refuses localhost, private, link-local and CGNAT destinations (including
  after DNS lookup and on redirects), so a crafted URL cannot turn the editor
  into an SSRF proxy. Remote SVG is refused: `/media/*.svg` is served
  same-origin as `image/svg+xml`, and a scripted SVG opened as a document
  would run on the editor origin. The stored `src` is always a local
  `/media/…` path. Local `.svg` files (drop / library) are unchanged.
  **`FABLECUT_TEST_IMPORT_ALLOW_PRIVATE=1`** is a test-only switch: it additionally
  allows **HTTP(S) to `127.0.0.1`** so the suite can pin a loopback fixture. It
  does not open LAN, CGNAT, link-local, metadata, `localhost`, `::1`, or other
  `127.0.0.0/8` addresses. Unset in production.

It remains **not** hardened for untrusted networks or multi-tenant use:

- The REST API (`/api/*`) has no authentication — anyone who can reach the port
  can read and overwrite `project.json`, upload files, and ask the server to
  fetch an HTTPS URL into `media/`.
- The server reads and writes files under the project directory and spawns
  `ffmpeg` for export/remux. Fast-export profiles in `encoding-profiles.json`
  (hot-reloaded) are raw ffmpeg argument lists: the browser sends only a
  profile id, args are passed to `spawn` with no shell, and a dry-run rejects
  bad args before any frames are rendered. That is expected in the local
  single-user model — anyone who can edit that file can already run ffmpeg on
  the machine.
- Do not expose the port publicly. If you must, put it behind your own
  authentication and network controls.

Reports about behavior that only occurs when the server is intentionally exposed
to untrusted networks are still welcome, but are lower priority than issues
exploitable in the intended local, single-user setup.
